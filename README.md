# Patrick Wagstrom's Vagrant Setup

This is a very simple setup for development using Vagrant. It's genesis came
from the need to develop some personal projects on a Windows machine, in
which case the use of Vagrant is nearly mandatory.

This isn't intended at the current time to be a best practices exemplar, rather
it's intended to be something that I can work with.
